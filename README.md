# Hospital-Rating-Prediction-Model
The solution methodology for this Capstone project follows a structured approach:  

Key Objectives:  
- Apply structured problem-solving techniques to identify root causes of issues at Evanston Hospital.
- Develop a hospital rating prediction model using historical data as a proof of concept.
-   
Solution Steps:  
1. Data Understanding & Preparation – Explore, clean, and preprocess the data for analysis. 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Perform univariate/bivariate analysis and apply feature engineering. 
3. Model Training – Train multiple machine learning models on the prepared dataset.  
4. Model Selection & Evaluation – Identify the best-performing model based on key metrics.  
5. Recommendations from the model outcomes– Interpret insights, present modelling results, and propose 
actionable solutions.
